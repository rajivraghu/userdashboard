In a future where Earth is becoming uninhabitable, former NASA pilot Cooper is recruited to fly a spacecraft through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. The mission explores several planets, facing challenges like time dilation. Ultimately, Cooper enters a black hole and, through a five-dimensional tesseract, communicates with his daughter across time, enabling her to save humanity. He is rescued and reunites with her before setting off to find a fellow astronaut on a new habitable world.
