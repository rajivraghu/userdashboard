The "Mission: Impossible" franchise is a series of action spy films starring Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an agent for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The films are known for their thrilling action sequences, intricate plots, and exotic locations.

The core of the series follows Hunt and his team as they undertake dangerous and seemingly impossible missions to protect global security. A recurring element is the "disavowal" of the IMF, forcing Hunt and his team to operate without official support.

- Mission: Impossible (1996): Hunt is framed and must uncover a mole within the IMF.
- Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011): The IMF is disavowed, and the team must prevent a nuclear war.
- Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015): Hunt tracks a rogue organization known as the Syndicate.
- Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018): A continuation of the fight against the Syndicate's remnants.
- Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023): The team confronts a powerful AI known as the Entity.
